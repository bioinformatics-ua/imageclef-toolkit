# ImageCLEF caption toolkit

This section contains tools for the concept detection sub-task of ImageCLEF Caption. It comprises the following tools:

- [imageclef-aae](imageclef-aae): a TensorFlow program for unsupervised representation learning using auto-encoders with adversarial networks.
- [notebooks](notebooks): _Currently not available, but stay tuned!_ A set of Jupyter notebooks for training classifiers for the ImageCLEF concept detection task.

These tools were originally developed in the scope of the following paper:

> Eduardo Pinho and Carlos Costa. _Feature Learning with Adversarial Networks for Concept Detection in Medical Images: UA.PT Bioinformatics at ImageCLEF 2018_, CLEF working notes, CEUR, 2018.
