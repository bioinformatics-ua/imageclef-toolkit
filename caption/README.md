# ImageCLEF caption toolkit

This section contains tools for the concept detection sub-task of ImageCLEF Caption. It comprises the following tools:

- [imageclef-aae](imageclef-aae): a TensorFlow program for unsupervised representation learning using auto-encoders with adversarial networks.
- [notebooks](notebooks): A set of Jupyter notebooks for training classifiers for the ImageCLEF concept detection task.
- [concept-count](concept-count) is a simple CLI tool which counts all concepts in the concepts file.
- [merge-submission](merge-submission) is a simple CLI tool to merge submission files for the concept detection task.


These tools were originally developed in the scope of the following paper:
